# Machine Learning Project on House Price and Lead Scoring Prediction

This project aims to utilize machine learning models to develop predictive models for house prices in the real estate investment industry, using various house or property features to train the model. Additionally, it features a lead scoring system that prioritizes prospective clients or properties for investment, utilizing a range of data-driven metrics.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. House Price Prediction: Predicts the price of a house/property based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, etc.

2. Lead Scoring Prediction: Scores and prioritizes leads (potential buyers or investment properties) based on their likelihood to convert, using machine learning classification techniques.


## Features

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Multiple regression models for price prediction (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Classification models for lead scoring (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Model evaluation with metrics (RMSE, MAE, Accuracy, ROC-AUC)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Interactive dashboards/visualizations (if applicable)

## Data Description

The dataset(s) used contain(s) the following features (sample):

- For House Price Prediction:
  - Location (city, neighborhood)
  - Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
  - Square footage/area
  - Year built
  - Property type
  - Amenities (garage, pool, etc.)
  - Sale price

- For Lead Scoring:
  - Lead source
  - Client demographics
  - Property interest
  - Interaction history
  - Conversion (target variable)

Note: Data sources may include public Kaggle datasets, open real estate APIs, or synthetic/generated data for demonstration.

## Usage

- Run Jupyter Notebooks:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  Open the desired notebook from the `notebooks/` directory.

- Run dashboards (if available):
  ```bash
  cd dashboards
  streamlit run app.py   # or python app.py for Dash/Flask apps
  ```

## Modeling Approach

- House Price Prediction:
  - Feature engineering (one-hot encoding, scaling)
  - Model training: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
  - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

- Lead Scoring:
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
  - Evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
